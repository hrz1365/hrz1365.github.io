I’m a data scientist with over **10 years of experience** applying predictive
modeling, machine learning, and geospatial analysis to problems where decisions have
real-world, long-term consequences.

My work sits at the intersection of **data science, domain expertise, and
decision-making**, with a focus on energy systems, infrastructure planning, and
climate-related impacts.

## How I Approach Problems

I’m most interested in problems where **forecasting, uncertainty, and spatial
context** matter more than optimizing a single metric.

Across projects, I emphasize:
- understanding system behavior rather than just fitting models  
- combining machine learning with simulation and scenario analysis  
- making uncertainty explicit and decision-relevant  
- building models that stakeholders can trust and act on

## Areas of Focus

- **Predictive modeling & forecasting** for energy, transportation, and public
  systems
- **Large Language Models** for analysis, interpretation, and communication 
- **Simulation and scenario analysis** to explore future pathways under
  uncertainty  
- **Geospatial analytics** across large spatial and temporal scales  
- **Uncertainty-aware modeling** for decision support

## Experience & Impact

I’ve worked across **energy, climate, population, and public-health domains**,
collaborating with researchers, engineers, and policy-focused teams.

My work has:
- supported infrastructure planning and electrification analysis  
- contributed to national-scale forecasting efforts  
- informed climate vulnerability and adaptation research  
- been published in *Nature Communications*, with an additional paper accepted for publication in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*.

## What I Value in Collaboration

I enjoy working on teams that value:
- rigorous thinking and open discussion  
- cross-disciplinary collaboration  
- clear communication between technical and non-technical audiences  
- models as tools for insight and decision-making, not ends in themselves
