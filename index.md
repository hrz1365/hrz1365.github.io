### Data Scientist · Machine Learning · Energy & Climate Analytics

I build **predictive, geospatial, and language-model–driven systems** to support
**infrastructure planning, energy transition, and climate-related decision-making**.

With over **10 years of experience**, my work sits at the intersection of
data science, domain expertise, and real-world impact — translating complex data
into **actionable insights for governments, utilities, and global organizations**.

---

## 🔍 What I Work On

- **Predictive modeling & forecasting** for energy, transportation, and infrastructure systems  
- **Geospatial analytics** across large spatial and temporal scales  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for interpreting technical and policy reports  
- **Decision-support tools** that balance rigor, uncertainty, and practicality

## 🧠 How I Approach Problems

I focus on **trustworthy, interpretable modeling** — especially where decisions
have long-term consequences. My work emphasizes:

- understanding system behavior, not just prediction accuracy  
- integrating spatial and temporal context  
- communicating results clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders

## 📌 Highlights

- 10+ years of applied data science experience  
- Published research in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*  
- Experience across energy, climate, population, and infrastructure domains
