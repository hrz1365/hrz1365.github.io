### Data Scientist · Predictive Modeling · LLMs · Energy & Climate Systems

I design **predictive models and simulation-based analytics** to support
**long-term planning and decision-making** in energy, transportation, public health, and
climate-related systems.

I also generate **AI-enabled** pipelines based on **Large Language Models** to generate insights 
and improve evidence-based understanding.

With over **10 years of experience**, my work focuses on combining
**machine learning, statistical modeling, and spatial analysis**
to understand system behavior under uncertainty and future scenarios.

## 🔍 Core Areas of Focus

- **Predictive modeling & forecasting** using machine learning and simulation
- **LLMs** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and prompt engineering  
- **Scenario analysis** for energy demand, electrification, and infrastructure planning  
- **Geospatial modeling** across large spatial and temporal scales  
- **Uncertainty-aware analytics** to support real-world decisions

## 🧠 Modeling Philosophy

My approach emphasizes **understanding systems, not just fitting models**.
I prioritize:

- interpretability and transparency over black-box accuracy  
- simulation and scenario exploration alongside machine learning  
- models that inform planning decisions, not just predictions  

Language models are used selectively to **augment analysis and interpretation**
when working with complex documentation and unstructured information.
